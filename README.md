# Bellum.ai 
This web tool aims to provide three services to players of the popular tabaletop miniature wargame [Warhammer 40,000](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jan/21/heroin-for-middle-class-nerds-how-warhammer-took-over-gaming-games-workshop). It is a work in progress.

1. Analyse Lists: Upload your Battlescribe lists for next level Mathhammer.
2. Play Faster: Update the tool as you play to always know which dice come next.
3. Learn Tactics: Live statistical feedback, suggested paths of action, and more to come. 

## Client Implementation
- The client for this application is a React single page application. 
- State is managed centrally via Redux, which also serves as the primary interface for REST communication with the server.
- It uses [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) for 3D graphics + interaction, [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) for data visualization, [react-spring](https://www.react-spring.io/) for animation, and [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) as a layout framework. See package.json for a full dependency list (about 10MB final size :grimace:).
- Authentication is handled via custom components provided by a SSO service, [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), both for login services and secure communication with the server's REST API.

## Server Implementation
- The server is implemented as an Express Node.js, using the [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) web framework for linking and routing. 
- The application is backed by a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database, which stores game data only, no authentication information.
- API is secured using the aforementioned Auth0, which provides JWTs that are checked before every interaction.
- The code is roughly organized into three groups:

## Running This Code

A combo of two npm projects, the backend server and the frontend UI. So there are two `package.json` configs and therefore two places to run `npm` commands:

1. [**Node server**](server/): [`./package.json`](package.json)
   - [deployed automatically](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/deployment) via heroku/nodejs buildpack
2. [**React UI**](react-ui/): [`react-ui/package.json`](react-ui/package.json)
   - generated by [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
   - deployed via `build` script in the Node server's [`./package.json`](package.json)
   - module cache configured by `cacheDirectories`
