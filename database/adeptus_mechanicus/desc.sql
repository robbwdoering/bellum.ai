	-- All units with this ability gain a bonus during the battle depending on the Canticle of the Omnissiah currently being canted.

Before the battle, if your Warlord is an ADEPTUS MECHANICUS CHARACTER and their <FORGE WORLD> is either RYZA, MARS, LUCIUS, METALICA, GRAIA, AGRIPINAA or STYGIES, you can select one of the Canticles of the Omnissiah to be replaced by that <FORGE WORLD>s Canticle. When a Forge World canticle from the list below is chanted, it only affects units from the appropriate <FORGE WORLD>. For example, your army includes a Warlord model from the RYZA FORGE, you can replace one Canticle from the Canticles of the Omnissiah with the Citation in Savagery Canticle. When this Canticle is chanted, it only affects RYZA units from your army.

At the start of each battle round, pick which Canticle of the Omnissiah from the table below is in effect for the duration of the battle round. The same Canticle may not be picked twice during the same battle.

Alternatively, you can randomly determine which Canticle of the Omnissiah is in effect by rolling a D6 and consulting the table below. Note that if you randomly determine a Canticle, it takes effect even if the same Canticle has been in effect earlier in the battle.

If you have a Battle-forged army, units only receive the bonus if every model in their Detachment has this ability.

1. Incantation of the Iron Soul:
You can re-roll failed Morale tests for affected units.

2. Litany of the Electromancer:
Roll a D6 for each enemy unit that is within 1 of any affected units; on a roll of 6, the unit being rolled for suffers D3 mortal wounds.

3. Chant of the Remorseless Fist:
You can re-roll any failed hit rolls of 1 for affected units in the Fight phase.

4. Shroudpsalm:
Affected units gain the bonus to their armour saving throws as if they were in cover. Units already in cover are unaffected.

5. Invocation of Machine Might:
Affected units have +1 Strength.

6. Benediction of the Omnissiah:
You can re-roll failed hit rolls of 1 for affected units in the shooting phase.
