	-- All ADEPTUS ASTARTES, HERETIC ASTARTES and FALLEN models gain this ability.
Instead of following the normal rules for Rapid Fire weapons, models in this unit firing Rapid Fire bolt weapons make double the number of attacks if any of the following apply:
• The firing model’s target is within half the weapon’s maximum range.
• The firing model is INFANTRY and every model in its unit remained stationary in your previous Movement phase.
• The firing model is a TERMINATOR, BIKER, CENTURION, DREADNOUGHT or HELBRUTE.
For the purposes of this ability, a Rapid Fire bolt weapon is any weapon with the Rapid Fire type whose profile includes the word ‘bolt’ (e.g. boltgun, bolt rifle, storm bolter, combi-bolter, hurricane bolter, inferno boltgun, etc.). This also applies when firing the boltgun profile of combi-weapons (including the bolt weapon profile of Relics such as Blood Song and the Lion’s Wrath) and when firing relics that replace a Rapid Fire bolt weapon, so long as the relic is also a Rapid Fire weapon (e.g. Primarch’s Wrath and Fury of Deimos). The Gauntlets of Ultramar and the Talon of Horus are also Rapid Fire bolt weapons, as is the guardian spear used by Deathwatch Watch Masters.
