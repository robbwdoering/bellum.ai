Subtract one from the leadership characteristic of enemy demon units whilst they are within 6” of a model from your army with this relic. In addition once per phase, with that model fires overwatch or is chosen to shoot with, it can unleash the light of Saint Agnaetha’s holy frames. When it does select one enemy unit within 12 inches of that model (if firing overwatch you must select the charging unit) and roll one D6; on a 2+ the enemy suffers D3 mortal wounds; if that enemy is a demon unit, it suffers d6 mortal wounds instead.  When a model from your army with this relic unleashes the holy flames, after its effects have been resolved, you can discard one miracle base. If you do not, that model cannot unleash the light of Saint Agnaetha’s holy flames again during this battle.

Determine which Sacred Rite is active for all units from your army with this ability at the start of the battle. To do so, after deployment but before the first battle round begins, select one Sacred Rite from the following table to be active. Alternatively, you can roll two D6 to randomly generate two Sacred Rites to be active (a duplicate result has no additional effect, but is considered to be active for the purposes of the Battle Rites Stratagem). In either case, Sacred Rites are active until the end of the battle.

1. Hand of the Emperor:
When a unit with this Sacred Rite Advances, add 1 to the Advance roll. When you make a charge roll for a unit with this Sacred Rite, add 1 to the result.

2. Spirit of the Martyr:
When a model with this Sacred Rite is destroyed, roll one D6 before removing the model from play. On a 5+ that model can either shoot with one of its ranged weapons as if it were your Shooting phase, or make one attack with one of its melee weapons as if it were the Fight phase (if the model has a damage table, use the bottom row of that table when shooting with that ranged weapon or resolving that attack with a melee weapon).

3. Aegis of the Emperor:
When a Deny the Witch test is taken for a model with this Sacred Rite, add 3 to the roll.

4. Divine Guidance:
When resolving an attack made with a ranged weapon by a model with this Sacred Rite, on an unmodified roll of 6 the Armour Penetration characteristic of that weapon is improved by 1 for that attack (e.g. AP 0 becomes AP -1).

5. The Passion:
When resolving an attack made with a melee weapon by a model with this Sacred Rite, an unmodified hit roll of 6 scores 1 additional hit.

6. Light of the Emperor:
When a Morale test is taken for a unit with this Sacred Rite, you can re-roll the dice.
