When you set up a unit in ambush, place one ambush marker anywhere on the battlefield that is wholly within your deployment zone. You will need one ambush marker for each unit that will deploy in this way. If you set up a TRANSPORT in ambush, you must still tell your opponent what units are embarked within it when it is set up in ambush - do not set up separate ambush markers for units that start the battle embarked within a TRANSPORT, even if they have the Cult Ambush ability.

In matched play, units set up in ambush using this rule count as being set up on the battlefield for the purposes of Tactical Reserves.

For ambush markers, see Codex: Genestealer Cults p79.

Matched Play: In matched play, units set up in ambush using this rule do not count as being Strategic Reserves or Reinforcement units.
